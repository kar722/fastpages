### Capture information that will grow to 10 CB Units
- Watch main daily videos on CollegeBoard
  - capture key code segments into jupyter notebooks organized by units
- Practice AP Frqs and MCs all throughout the year but more and more as we get closer to the AP test date
- CollegeBoard work is more essential for AP test and PBLs can help with AP test if CollegeBoard key concepts are used

As AP Test date gets closer I will:
- Assess my strengths and weakness
  - focuses on making my weaknesses my strengths by reviewing old material as well as finding new material
- Practice MC questions
- Practice FRQs
- Take full practice tests
